# Welcome to unfinished territory.

This is discontinued BYOND software that acts as a BYOND chat client with some encryption.
It is not in a state of usability. If you want to use it for your own purposes, go right ahead.

Personally, I just want to do other things and my motivation for this project ceased when my only use for it became obsolete.

You don't need to credit me.. but it'd be cool if ya did.
